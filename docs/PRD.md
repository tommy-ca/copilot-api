# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Copilot API Rust Migration

### Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the core performance-critical components of the Copilot API proxy from TypeScript/Node.js to Rust to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance reliability.

### Current Product Overview

The Copilot API is a reverse-engineered proxy that exposes GitHub Copilot as OpenAI and Anthropic compatible API endpoints. It enables developers to use GitHub Copilot with any tool that supports these standard APIs, including Claude Code.

   - Token counting API (`/v1/messages/count_tokens`)

2. **Authentication & Token Management**
   - GitHub OAuth device flow authentication
   - Automatic Copilot token refresh (every refresh_in - 60 seconds)
   - Token persistence and caching
   - Support for individual, business, and enterprise GitHub accounts

3. **Request Processing**
   - HTTP request/response proxying to GitHub Copilot backend
   - Streaming and non-streaming response handling
   - Request validation and payload transformation
   - Vision model support detection and header adjustment

4. **Performance & Control Features**
   - Rate limiting with configurable intervals
   - Manual request approval for fine-grained control
   - Wait-on-rate-limit functionality
   - Request/response logging and debugging

5. **Monitoring & Usage**
   - Usage statistics and quota monitoring
   - Web-based dashboard for usage visualization
   - Token visibility for debugging

6. **Integration**
   - Claude Code integration with automatic configuration
   - Docker containerization
   - NPX distribution
